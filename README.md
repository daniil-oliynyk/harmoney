## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Orange juice and toothpaste. Bleach and annomia. Lego bricks and feet. Friends and money. These pairs all have one thing in common: they are best left unmixed. Mixing friends and money can be an unnecessary source of strain in friendships. Harmoney is a group payments solution that eliminates these pain points.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. At large, this section 
should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product. 
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution. 

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
Harmoney aims to solve situations involving 

- Splitting dinner
- Splitting a recurring monthly bill
- Group gift
This section is used to describe potential solutions. 

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been 
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.
